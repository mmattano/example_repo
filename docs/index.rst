Welcome to Example Repo's documentation!

Our example repo is supposed to help new members of the AutoFlow team to get up to speed on the basics of software development using Python. It provides examples, guides and explanations for creating a new Python package with distinct modules, proper documentation, unit tests and a CircleCI framework.
